# KnowledgeAndDataEngineering

*Research questions*
Knowledge graph accuracy: How does integrating a medical knowledge graph (UMLS subset + symptom–disease dataset) improve the accuracy of automated diagnosis compared to baseline LLM or rule-based methods?

*Task division*
1. Data transformation + KG construction
2. Build agent in python that uses LLM
3. Integrate KG in agent
4. Build UI where a patient can fill in his/her symptoms and the UI will show the concept extracted from the text given by the patient and predict the disease
5. Evaluation
